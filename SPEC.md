# Cursa — macOS Mouse Automation Tool

## Overview

A lightweight macOS menu bar app for **making UI demos with cursor motion that looks designed, not captured**. Record a take, let Cursa smooth out the hand tremor, and loop it seamlessly while you screen-record — the cursor glides, clicks land on their targets, and the menu bar stays out of the shot. Also ships motion presets (circle, figure-8, back-and-forth line) for abstract cursor shots over product visuals.

**Target user:** designers, developers, and marketers shooting product demos, landing-page hero videos, App Store previews, docs GIFs, and Dribbble shots — anything where a cursor is part of the shot. Not a gaming macro tool or a QA automation framework; it's a screen-recording companion.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Swift
- **UI:** SwiftUI + AppKit (menu bar integration)
- **Target:** macOS 14+ (Sonoma)
- **Distribution:** Direct / outside App Store (no sandbox)

## Architecture

### Menu Bar App

- Lives primarily in the macOS menu bar (no Dock icon by default).
- Clicking the menu bar icon opens a dropdown with:
  - **Record / Stop Recording** toggle (shows the configured hotkey while recording is active)
  - **Play / Stop Playback** toggle
  - **Recording Loop Mode** submenu (Once, Ping-Pong, Repeat)
  - **Presets** (Circle, Figure-8, Line) — each opens a full-screen click-and-drag configuration overlay
  - **Settings…** (opens a config window)
  - **Quit**
- A small settings window (opened from menu) for configuring smoothing, loop mode, and hotkeys.

### Core Layers

1. **Input Capture** — `CGEventTap` to record global mouse positions + timestamps.
2. **Path Generator** — Protocol-based. Each preset (circle, figure-8, line) and recorded macros conform to the same `MousePath` protocol, producing a sequence of `(timestamp, x, y)` points.
3. **Playback Engine** — Timer-driven loop that posts `CGEvent` mouse-move events along a given path.

## Features

### MVP (v1)

#### Recording & Playback
- Record mouse movement (position + timing) while recording is active.
- Replay the most recent recording at original speed.
- Stop playback at any time.
- One recording slot in memory (new recording overwrites the old one).
- **Pre-roll countdown** — A 3-second countdown is shown in the menu bar before recording actually starts, giving the user time to move the mouse to the starting position.
- **Auto-cancel on user input** — Playback stops immediately if the physical mouse moves more than a few pixels from the expected (programmatic) position, so the user can always regain control.
- **Click recording** — Records left, right, and middle clicks (down + up events) alongside movement. Each click event stores the exact position and timestamp. During playback, clicks are replayed via `CGEvent` posting at the correct moments.
- **Smoothing slider** — Adjustable smoothing level (0% = raw input, 100% = heavily smoothed). Applies a moving-average smoothing pass (window scaled by the slider) to reduce jitter in recorded paths. Smoothing is applied fresh for each playback and is never destructive to the raw recording. **Click positions are pinned by index** — smoothing skips the exact sample points where a click event was recorded, so the mouse always arrives at the recorded (x, y) for each click.
- **Loop mode** — Three modes:
  - **Once** — Plays the recording once and stops.
  - **Ping-Pong** — Plays the recording forward, then in reverse, repeating until stopped.
  - **Repeat** — Plays the recording forward, loops back to the start, and repeats; the seam is blended over a short window (≤0.3s) to avoid a hard jump.

#### Motion Presets
- **Circle** — Configurable: center (x, y), radius (px), duration per revolution.
- **Figure-8** — Configurable: center (x, y), size, duration.
- **Back-and-forth line** — Configurable: start point, end point, duration.
- All presets loop continuously until stopped.
- **Interactive configuration overlay** — Selecting a preset opens a full-screen semi-transparent overlay. The user clicks and drags to set the geometry (center+radius for circle/figure-8, or start+end for line); a floating panel shows numeric fields + steppers for fine adjustment and a Start button to begin playback.

#### Controls
- **Menu bar dropdown** for all primary actions.
- **Global hotkeys** for hands-free use (defaults):
  - Record start/stop — `⌃⌥R`
  - Playback start/stop — `⌃⌥P`
  - Stop all — `⌃⌥X`
- Hotkeys are user-configurable in Settings and persisted via `UserDefaults`.

#### Permissions
- On first launch, check for Accessibility permission.
- If not granted, show a clear prompt explaining why it's needed and a button to open System Settings.
- Gracefully disable recording/playback features until permission is granted.

### Future (v2 — nice to have)

- Save/load recorded macros to files (JSON).
- Multiple recording slots / macro library.
- Adjustable playback speed (0.5x, 1x, 2x).
- Additional presets (square, spiral, random jitter).
- Dock icon toggle in settings.

## Non-Goals

- No App Store distribution or sandboxing.
- No iOS/iPadOS support.
- No scripting language or complex macro editor.
